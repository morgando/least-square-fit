# least-square-fit

This program will optimize a number of "q-values" attached to a hard coded function to minimize its square error with respect to input data.

contains two classes:

(1) Driver contains the main method that creates an object of type FunctionalFit, this object will automatically create a fit.

(2) FunctionalFit contains methods that create a functional fit for a hard-coded
function that minimizes square error.

In order for code to compile, current git version contains hard coded function meant to model Gaussian-shaped radioactive decay data.
